Hello. This is a simple Markdown file.

Note that this is Markdown, and not "R Markdown". That's my understanding...

Here is the guide to using it: https://www.markdownguide.org/

Markdown lets you create nice looking documents easily, without a lot of overhead.

<h1> This is a Big Heading. Level 1. </h1>

<h3> This is a smaller subheading. Level 3. </h3>

It is easy to do **bold** or by using the <strong>"strong"</strong> tag.
And same for *italics*. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

Lists are cool. First ordered ones.
1. The first thing.
2. A second thing.
17. Automatically the third thing.

And for bullets:
- First item
- Second item
    - subitem of this
    - another subitem
- Third item

Here's how you do a table.

| Person | Role | Present at 29/7 meeting? |

| Andrea | Developer | Yes |
